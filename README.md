This library is in beta. Don't use it for production environment !

## What is it ?

Sport JS facilitate the design of spatial situations, for sport purpose.
It integrates 3 sports for the moment :

You can place 'players' on a field, and move them step by step.

You can export the 'steps' and then store it somewhere, or not :-)
